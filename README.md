Game cloning:
Is it okay to clone another studios game?
copyright issues, digital watermarking, Intellectual Property

"What are the ethical issues of cloning video games and what can be done to prevent the copying of Intellectual Property". The games industry Is an extremely competitive market, and it is often a challenge for developers to think of good game ideas, this can lead to them "stealing" the idea from other developers. This is known as "cloning", they take the core idea of the game, sometimes they change it a little bit and change the look of the game, then they sell it as if it were there own game. I this essay I will talk about the ethical and moral issues that this causes and potential solutions to prevent cloning from happening. Is it wrong to clone a game, should it remain legal as long as you change the aesthetic of the game, or should there be stricter laws introduced to prevent the copy of Intellectual Property.
